This is the first post. Just testing that everything works.

## How this blog works

Posts are written in Markdown and stored in `src/content/blog/`. They automatically appear on the homepage, sorted by date.

## Code example

```typescript
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
```

That's it for now.
